Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.


class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        
    String bin = Integer.toBinaryString(num);
    int value = 0;
    for(int i = bin.length()-1 ; i >=0 ; i--)
    {
        if(bin.charAt(i) == '0')
            value = value + (int)Math.pow(2,bin.length()-1-i);        
    }
        return value;
    }
}
